Our Project is an implementation of one of the most classic games: Rock, Paper, Scissors.

In our version of the game, a user will have to pick between 3 options: rock, paper, or scissors.
Then, the computer in the background will randomly choose between the 3 options and
both selections will be compared and a custom dialog will be presented to the user.
There is also a score board to keep track of the points between the user and the computer.

This project also utilizes window.localStorage, so a user can refresh the page or close the window,
and then return at a later time and resume the game. In addition, we added the feature
to 'reset' everything in window.localStorage thus reverting the game back to its
default state.
